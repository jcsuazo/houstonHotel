## About This Project

Final project for Coursera course "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4"

This is a fictional website for a fictional client, the clients name is Houston Hotel, they are in need of a new website to promote their hotel.

We opted for a simple design that could show the beatty of the hotel and the main options available to their guess.

The design was going to have a sidebar but that design was to complex for the client.

I decided to use html, css, javascript and bootstrap to create the app, and use github pages has a host, because is free.

For this project i keep it simple, i only use Bootstrap, font-awesome, jquery and popper.js has my main dependencies.

This project was really fun to build, i did not knew that you can use Bootstrap for a project in this way, i though it was only good for prototyping.
